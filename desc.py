Awaken, O wanderer, to the words etched in the stones of time.
When the world of Equestria lies fractured, and harmony is but a fading memory, the shadow of Nightmare Moon shall descend upon all.
Once she was Princess Luna, guardian of dreams, but envy and sorrow twisted her into darkness unending.
Yet the stars foretell: From the ashes shall rise a hero. 
One who dares to tread through ruins and forgotten halls.
One who seeks the Elements of Harmony, scattered and hidden by fate.
One who will brave monsters, traps, and secrets untold.

Know this, chosen one: Only by uniting the six Elements of Harmony—Loyalty, Honesty, Generosity, Kindness, Laughter, and Magic—shall Nightmare Moon be cast down,and Princess Luna restored to her true self.
Should you falter, the Elements shall fall from your grasp, and if Nightmare Moon seizes them all, eternal night shall claim Equestria.
"

rules = 
"""
Your path begins in the vast castle, within lies the Garden, Kitchen, Tea Room, Drawing Room, Study, Chambers, Artillery, Crown Room, and Dungeon.
At the end, the Throne Room, where Nightmare Moon herself awaits.
Each chamber holds secrets and dangers so tread carefully, for every step binds your destiny.

In the castle rooms dwell mind-controlled ponies who have fallen prey to Nightmare Moon phonies. 
Each battle flows in turns, as in the old duels of balance: you strike back and forth until one falls.
Your choices in combat are these:
* Strike with weapon or spell.
* Shield against oncoming blows.
* Conjure Spells of great power, though some drain your life.
* Use Relics such as potions or healing elixirs.
Remember: every choice carves the story of your soul.
